# Titanic-Project

## Introduction
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died.
For this project, I was tasked with identifying factors that contributed to survival rate from the Titanic accident.
